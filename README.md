I'm a french student in the final year at the engineering school ENSEIRB-MATMECA. Here, you could find my personal and academic projects! I discovered artificial intelligence during an academic project and since that day, I love it! :heart_eyes: 

- :computer: I’m currently working on the project **Image aesthetics rating** using deep learning models.

- 💬 Please feel free to ask me about projects if there any issue or lack of information.

- :mag: I’m looking for an internship as a datascientist, starting from February (5-6 months) in Europe (Switzerland, Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, Italy).
